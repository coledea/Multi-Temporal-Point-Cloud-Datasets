## Notes

## Scripts
* `compute_statistics.py` computes the minimum, median, and maximum of the number of points and average point neighbor distance across all epochs


The expected folder structure for the data is as follows:

```
Riparian_Vegetation
  |-- epoch_1.las
  |-- epoch_2.las
  |-- epoch_3.las
  |-- ...
```
